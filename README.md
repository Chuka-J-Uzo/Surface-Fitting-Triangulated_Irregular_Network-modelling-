# Surface-Fitting-Algorithm (Using Triangulated Irregular Network modelling technique)
TIN modeling is a good option for fitting a surface to a set of point clouds in 3 dimensions, and below, we implement it using some Python libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, sklearn.preprocessing, PolynomialFeatures, sklearn.linear_model and LinearRegression.
